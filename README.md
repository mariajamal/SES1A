# UTS-SES-1A

This is the repo for the app we had to make in SES 1A

## Aim
The aim of the project was to develop  a fully functioning healthcare web application that leverages the power of the internet to give users the ability to chat with doctors, know their doctor's location and book online consultations.

## Prerequisites

`npm -v`
<br>
To install the required dependencies, run `npm install` in the project root directory.

## Development server

Run `npm run dev` for a dev server. Navigate to `http://localhost:5000/`. The app will automatically reload if you change any of the source files.
